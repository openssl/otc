** 3.3 release checklist pre-review

Alpha to happen soon. 
The only criteria is passing tests. The only failing is coverage.
THe branch is to be created by Richard today

** Proposed FIPS indicators design overview

Paul's proposal is to permit breaking FIPS requirements by raising a
operational flag before.

Kurt: things that are allowed in some contexts but not in all ones.

Paul: the question is if we support the compatibility with old releases.
We will have to update documentation, fipsinstall, etc

Shane: we can't just put it into the security policies

Paul: we should probaply fail and let people know about miscompliance
