** Review OTC project board

Nothing on the board

** PQC

ML-KEM-768 is the initial target for 3.5. Some discussion around the state of
hybrid standardisation and how that might impact 3.5 plans.

Algorithms will be stand alone and not parameterised (e.g. ML-KEM-768 is a
different algorithm to ML-KEM-1024).

There were be a generic "hybrid" implementation that can be parameterised at
compile time. Some discussion about whether the combiner function should be
runtime or compile time defined.

** Committer nominations

We discussed committer nominations.

** MD5 for certs

CA cert directory used to be hashed with MD5. All recent versions used SHA1.
There is a PR to try both (#24002). Android cert stores are still using MD5.

An option is to just use a single hash but make it compile time configurable.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

None

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None
