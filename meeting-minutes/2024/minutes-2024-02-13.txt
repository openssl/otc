** Review outstanding actions

None

** Symbol versioning

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/23534

We seem to have accidentally changed the symbol versions for two symbols
between 3.1 and 3.2.

Preferred resolution seems to be to list both symbol versions in the symbol
table for next 3.2.x release. This ensures compatibility with applications
built against both 3.1 and 3.2.

Outputs:
- List both symbol versions to resolve this issue
- Create issue for adding CI check to ensure this doesn't happen again

** Performance issues (Dmitry)

We continue to receive feedback on performance issues in 3.x.

We have an issue to track performance investigations:
    https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/441

We have resources assigned to investigating performance issues
and resolving them, which are tracked in the above epic.

** Review OTC project board

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#17469: We shouldn't use atexit() in our libraries (or modules, engines and
providers alike)
    OTC: Would it be to OK to backport the no-atexit support (without the
    NonStop changes) to 3.2?

Topic: #23394 (without the NonStop changes) can be backported to 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0

#23400, #23537: WIP: Add compatibility mode with 3.0 fipsinstall
    OTC: This cannot go in as is - there must be no option added and the FIPS
    module must be autodetected.

#23464: Fix coverity missing_lock warnings
    Defer, pending investigation of Coverity model files and #ifdef'd _Pragma.

#23483: Lower bound checks for GeneralizedTime and UTCTime.
    OTC: In 3.x we could accept a documentation change to say that these
    functions accept incorrectly encoded time values without the seconds part,
    but we may consider removing this handling by 4.0 release.
