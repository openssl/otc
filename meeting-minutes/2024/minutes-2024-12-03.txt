#26046: X509 chain validation: non-standard handling of EKU extensions in CA
certs

[Shane joined]

We need to document the current behaviour
For considering changing the behaviour of the strict flag we would need a survey
of the behaviour of other major libraries (NSS, GnutTLS, BouncyCastle, Microsoft
Crypto API) and the impact that this change of behaviour would make

#26079 CMS_get1_{certs, crls} behaviour change and inconsistency with
CMS_get0_signers() in OpenSSL 3.4

If there were no certs/crls we used to return NULL and now we return an empty
stack.

We will revert the behaviour change of the CMS_get1_certs/crls() functions in
master and 3.4 branches. We will add an internal call for replacement in 3.4 and
new public API call in 3.5

** EVP_SKEY

#25908 - Dmitry is asking OTC members for review of the EVP_SKEY implementation

There was a discussion about whether or not we should have an EVP_SKEY "empty"
state and whether you can change the state later.

We discussed the empty key creation patter and we will discuss again next week
when everybody has had the opportunity to review the comments in the PR

** Review outstanding security issues
