** Review OTC project board

#652 Raise question with the lab

Questions were sent to lab. The rough consensus seems to be that the health
check should be done on the raw output of the noise source which is not inside
our FIPS module boundary.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#12010 Allow 100 chars per source line and check for non-allowed tabs

80 characters is a soft limit. At the moment there are too many places where we
exceed even the 100 characters limit. It would be nice to have a CI check for
this but without fixing (or somehow waiving) these existing places we cannot
enforce such check.

The other possible coding style CI checks that could be enforced should include
non-allowed tabs and trailing spaces, EOLs and missing EOLs at EOF.


#12721 OpenSSL is sloppy with SSL/TLS cert key usage checks

We would like to have the strict check with an SSL_OP to switch it off/on. In a
minor release this check should be off by default and we could change the
default in the next major release.

#15335 TLS 1.0/1.1 and DTLS 1.0 formally deprecated

Project issue #672 raised to investigate how the seclevel check is applied to
TLS.

#24621: Support converting ed25519 key to x25519 key

This cannot be merged without a public API. That API documentation would have
to clearly state the security implications of such conversion.

#24636 Pipelining support in provided ciphers

We are OK in principle. We would like to see draft documentation or a design
document so it could be reviewed in detail.

Docs should answer for example:
- Whether the numpipes argument should be repeated
- how aead is going to be handled

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

Nothing to discuss

None
