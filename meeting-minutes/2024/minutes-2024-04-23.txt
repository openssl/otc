** Review OTC project board

[Shane joined]

245 FIPS indicators:
This has been updated by Shane. To be treated as a PR and removed from the
project board.

468 Handling Non-ASCII output
Issue 24157 has been raised describing the problem in more detail. Nothing more
for OTC to do.

436 legacy provider policy
We are ok with the draft policy - it should be raised as a general policy

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

23240: Add EdDSA support to EVP_PKEY_sign/verify
There are some concerns about a confusing API.
Richard to review the design and update according to comments. 23240 is kept on
hold until the design is complete.

24105: SHAKE128/SHAKE256
We cannot move the OIDs to new algorithm names (because old providers will still
have the OID associated with the wrong names).
We should break the algorithms to require setting the length. This is a breaking
change.

Vote:
The EVP_DigestFinal() and EVP_Digest() functions should fail for SHAKE-128 and
SHAKE-256 unless the xoflen param is set by the application.
