[Richard Levitte joned the call]

#24358 zeroize rsa->p, rsa->q on error

This is good practice and p, q are private values. PR is OK as is

#24387 rsa no xof

We are OK with this not requiring a way to enable in FIPS MODULE. 

The reason is that it is unlikely to be used by applications and for the
eventual rare use-case as this is non-approved the fallback is to use the
default provider.

** Review Functions for explicitly fetched signature algorithms design #22672

[Paul Dale joined the call]

Long discussion about the introduction of the EVP_PKEY_sign_primitive* functions
compared with the existing primitive sign functions (EVP_PKEY_sign). Also

No consensus at this stage to be discussed again next week
