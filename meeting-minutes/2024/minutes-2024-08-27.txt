** Nominations

Matt to raise committer nomination votes on list.

** Reviews

Proposal is to drop the OTC review requirement (so two committer reviews agreed
required instead of the one committer and one OTC member). Some discussion
about increasing the review count. Suggestion about having code owners for
parts of the code.

General consensus that we should have more reviewers/committers.

** Signature changes

Some concerns about the time remaining before freeze for getting this code in.

** LTS

Discussion about which release should be the next LTS, and the approach moving
forward. To be discussed further once BACs/TACs are established.

** FIPS

A discussion about the next FIPS release, and the outstanding FIPS indicators
work. PR 25162 needs a second review.

** Review OTC project board

Deprecation of TLS1.0/1.1 #750

Work is in progress

Create a proposal for making min/max key sizes configurable #809

Waiting on a resource to work on this

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

Document the output length behaviour of AES-WRAP-PAD #25233

Defer

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None

** PQC

Questions have been raised about implementing the new standards.
It is our intention to have implementations of these standards. We do not yet
have a timescale for it. It would be nice if we had volunteer to help contribute
implementations. We should have a blog post saying this.
