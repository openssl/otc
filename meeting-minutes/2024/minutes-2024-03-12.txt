It seems we will really require explicit indicators.

AI everyone to read the design proposal in the above PR.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#22203 - key_share/supported_group selection algorithm is suboptimal for
post-quantum

OTC recommends implementing a solution for this problem in 3.4.

#23075 - EVP_DigestSign fails when called second time in 3.2.0
