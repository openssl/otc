** Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda

Hugo volunteered to take the minutes.
Proposed: Hugo, seconded: Matt

Agenda for the meeting agreed. Proposed: Hugo, seconded: Tomas

** Agree minutes from previous meeting

Minutes from previous meeting were agreed. Proposed: Hugo, seconded: Nicola

** Review outstanding actions

AI: Anton to write a policy for feature branches (including how to review rebases)
    A feature branch approval policy has been created:
        https://github.com/openssl/general-policies/pull/62
    A full feature branch policy will be developed later.
    Dropping this issue.

AI: Anton to create an OTC tab on the project board
Done

** HACS and Real World Crypto conferences

ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/430

We are happy for any regular OTC participant to represent the OTC
at HACS or RWC. Nicola is confirmed as attending RWC.

Anyone requiring expense coverage should email the OMC ahead of time.

We are comfortable with potentially having multiple people representing the
project.

** Discussion with OQS Project

ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/431 (assigned to Nicola)

Nicola is planning an extended visit to the OQS project.
They are interested in talking to an OTC member about project plans
regarding post-quantum cryptography.

We want to develop a post-quantum cryptography plan but have yet to
do so, therefore it makes little sense to try and represent our position.
However, opening a dialogue with them would be a good idea.

Both OTC and non-OTC groups should engage in dialogue.

Nicola will engage in discussion and form a list of topics which
can be the basis of future group meetings.

Nicola could also attend the LF Open Source Summit.

AI: Hugo to email Kajal to consider if we should attend LF Open Source Summit

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#22903: TLSv1.3: add optional integrity-only ciphers [RFC 9150]
    Are we OK with the concept of integrity-only ciphers?
    It is similar to existing NULL cipher support.

    OTC: This is based on an informational track RFC. Are we ok with integrating
    support on that basis?
    OTC: We are OK with including support for integrity-only ciphers according
    to RFC 9150.

    OTC: This changes the public EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH from 16 to 48 - which is not
    allowed in a minor release. How should we handle this situation? Similarly
    EVP_MAX_AEAD_TAG_LENGTH changes from 16 to 48.
    OTC: The EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH and EVP_MAX_AEAD_TAG_LENGTH macros cannot be
    changed in 3.x versions as this breaks API and ABI stability requirements.

AI: Someone to investigate NULL cipher policy and communicate it
    in relation to #22903
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/433

AI: Determine preferred approach for TLS 1.3 integrity-only ciphersuites (CIPHER vs MD)
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/434

AI: Identify possible ways to discard the various EVP_MAX...LENGTH macros
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/435

#23075: EVP_DigestSign fails when called second time in 3.2.0
    OTC: Is it a regression that we now require the EVP_MD_CTX to be
    reinitialised between EVP_DigestSign calls?

    Removing the OTC hold until the investigation is done.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Moving algorithms to the legacy provider

It has been suggested we should have a policy on moving algorithms
to the legacy provider.

AI: Write up an explanation of the rationale behind the legacy provider
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/437

AI: Write a proposed policy on moving algorithms to the legacy provider
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/436
(blocked on above)

** Review draft technical policies

None

** AOB

Propose API deprecations for 3.3
ISSUE: https://github.com/openssl/project/issues/432

There will be no OTC meeting on 27 Feb.

** Agree agenda for next meeting

    * Nominate a minute taker and confirm agenda
    * Agree minutes from previous meeting
    * Review outstanding actions
    * Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)
    * Review outstanding security issues
    * Review draft technical policies
    * Agree agenda for next meeting
    * AOB
