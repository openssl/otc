** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#23866 Set secure defaults for the SHAKE 128/256 digest output length

Lenghty discussion reiterating the arguments from two weeks ago.

Tomas proposed breaking the DigestFinal() for SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 algorithms
if XOFLEN is not set, and create SHAKE-128/256 and SHAKE-256/512 aliases which
provide correct defaults. Possibly with moving the OIDs to these aliases.

Tomas will work on alternative PR implementing the above proposal.
