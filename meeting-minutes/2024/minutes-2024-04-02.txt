** Review OTC project board

#436: Write a proposed policy on moving things to the legacy provider
Still blocked

#245: FIPS indicators
To be discussed later

#389: Recording strategy
No Updates

#458: Handling non-ASCII output
No update

** Managing SignatureAlgorithms from configuration in the age of providers #23784

[Nicola Tuveri joined]

AI: Tomas to investigate why config_diagnostics does not have an effect (#517)

Current thinking is that we should report errors in the case of bad sig algs and
conf_diagnostics is set - but to make this change in 3.4 or later (not before).

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

Set secure defaults for SHAKE 128/256 digest output length (#23877)

Defer until next week as a separate agenda item

Design document about handling MAX defines (#23883)

No action - proceed as per normal review process. Hold lifted.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None

** FIPS indicators

We need to have indicators of some form. The preferred solution will fail if
something is not FIPS compliant, but you can pass a parameter which allows the
check to override this.

There was a discussion around the issue that if FIPS rules change (as they
frequently do), then this could introduce breaking changes in stable releases.
Should we have some option that enables override of this? Consensus is that
we should not use explicit indicators for now. We should use implicit indicators
with a per-operation bypass.
