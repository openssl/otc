** 3.3 release checklist review

[Richard Levitte joined]

Release checking is in project #420

With regards API changes, Dmitry raised this:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23554

This is important, but it is not a regression in 3.3 and so is not a release
blocker.

OSX threads test is still failing (#23967). This is an RCU problem which is not
actually used anywhere. We will disable the test for now. It must be reenabled
before any functionality that uses RCU is added.

Issue #23773 is still outstanding for 3.3.0 milestone. Other issues have had this
milestone removed. CIs are failing due to a sub-module update being missing.
To be marked as urgent.

CHANGES and NEWS needs updating. Matt to do this.

OTC approve the source is ready for 3.3 beta release subject to the following
occuring prior to beta release:
- req return value change must be merged (#23773)
- RCU test should be disabled for Mac platform (#23967)
- CHANGES and NEWS should be updated

** Discuss #23720 (OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config loads system config
  even when a particular config is specified)

Any API call might end up with the system config being loaded. In the future we
would like all globals to be held in the libctx - but this a 4.0 change.

Not much further can be done with this until 4.0.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#23866 Set secure defaults for the SHAKE 128/256 digest output length

This is problematic because changing this length could cause buffer overflows in
calling applications.

Options:

- We can just change the default length of the SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 algorithms

- We can remove the OID from the old SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 algorithms and move
the OID to be against new SHAKE-128/256 and SHAKE-256/512 algorithms.

No decision made as yet.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies
