** #19084 (Tim)

Defer

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

#22264: Limit the number of http headers when receiving the http response
    OTC: This is not a security issue however we should limit the number
    processsed headers to some reasonably high number.

#22896: FYI: Purported UB around generic functions like OPENSSL_LH_HASHFUNC
    OTC: We should attempt to fix it via thunking but we must keep the ABI stable.

#22955: KU_* and X509v3_KU_* constants are redundant

#22995: Add appropriate NULL checks in EVP_CIPHER api
    OTC: Because of backwards compatibility reasons we should return 0 as error
    from EVP_CIPHER_get_iv_length().

#23050: Ignore unknown sigalgs and groups in the configuration
    OTC: This should not be backported to 3.2 branch because this is not a bug fix.

#23075: EVP_DigestSign fails when called second time in 3.2.0
    OTC: We need to investigate whether the original code produced valid
    signatures in the subsequent EVP_DigestSign() calls.
