** Review OTC project board

Nothing to be done

** Review proposal for deprecation of TLS1.0/1.1 and DTLS1.0

The proposal in openssl/project#750 is to set the min protocol version to
DTSLv1.2

Some discussion about whether this is useful, and whether it is really
deprecation.

A proposed deprecation path could be to compile out tls1.0/1.1 support by
default from 4.0. We could ask this on the oss-security list.

AI: Neil to formulate a question and post to the oss-security list

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

There are no issue with OTC hold (without the 4.0 milestone)

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None

** AOB

Dmitry mentioned openssl/openssl#25002. Would such a feature be acceptable?
OTC thinks this would be ok.

Shane requests review of the FIPS indiciator PRs (see #24849 for a list)

Nicola asked about the code freeze for 3.4. Neil has a blog post about this in
review.
