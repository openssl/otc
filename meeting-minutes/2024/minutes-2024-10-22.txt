Nothing on the board

** Approval for 3.4 release

We ran through the release check list:
 - There were some coverity issues which were not relevant to the 3.4 branch
 - The coveralls run on 3.4 has not been setup. However we do not expect the
   coverage to have dropped based on the master results
 - We were a couple of days late freezing the release
 - There were some changes merged yesterday

Vote: The source is approved for release subject to a manual run of coveralls
      to confirm that the coverage is no worse than the previous release
