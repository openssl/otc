** Review OTC project board

Proposal for deprecation of TLS 1.0/1.1 and DTLS 1.0

We requested feedback from oss-security. We got conflicting feedback. Some
people want us to turn of TLS 1.0/1.1 immediately. Others want us to keep it
working for the foreseeable future.

[Shane Lontis joined]

AI: Neil to summarise the existing feedback and to create a github discussion
and blog to elicit further feedback (along with an announcement to
openssl-users GH Discussion Announcements).

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

increse rsa min bits to 1024 (#25094)

Discussion around the pros and cons of this:
- why 1024 and not 2048?
- This is a breaking change and probably needs to wait until 4.0
- This will cause problems for tests where 512 is commonly used for speed reasons
- Should this minimum be compile time or run time?
- A run time default that can be changed without recompilation might be possible
  in a minor release

Raised an issue openssl/project#809 to create a proposal for making various
min/max key sizes configurable

We should create a "hold: breaking change" label
AI: Matt to create the label
