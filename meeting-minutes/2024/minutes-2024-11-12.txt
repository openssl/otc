18734: Make non-sensitive portions of the trace API use accessible to all users

Are there any performance or security implications of turning on the trace
functionality by default.

Some discussion about whether we should have a logging API (and whether the
ERR API could be it).

We would be ok with enabling TRACE by default in debug builds.

25716: Buffer file-based BIO reads on Winddows

Remove the hack where we disable buffering on file in Windows which has severe
performance impact. Instead we always open files in binary mode on Windows.

Can we backport this?

This is reverting behaviour back to 1.1.1 behaviour and this is considered
low risk.

[Sasha Nedvedicky joined]
[Tim Hudson joined]

We don't normally backport performance fixes as far back as 3.0.
This is OK to go back to the 3.4 branch.

25930 fips-jitter: Forse use jitter entropy in the FIPS 3.0.9 provider
callback

Defer this discussion until Pauli is present

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed security issues.

** EVP_SKEY

There was some discussion about whether the EVP_SKEY design fits with PKCS11
requirements. We might need to make updates to the design. This is a work
in progress.

separate design meeting.
