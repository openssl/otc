** Review OTC project board

Create proposal for deprecation of TLS 1.0/1.1 and DTLS 1.0 protocols
(#750)
 - waiting on blog post approval

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

dtls_meth.c: Silently drop records with invalid MAC (#25353)
- deferred

Additional, reduced round ChaCha ciphers (#25347)
- this is outside of our policy, and to really achieve the performance gain,
the implementation would have to be done in assembler for the exact number
of rounds. Thus it would be quite unusual to have the number of rounds as
OSSL_PARAM of the algorithm.
- In the absence of a national or international standard specifying the use
of reduced-round ChaCha, we recommend this be implemented as a third-party
provider.

Document the output length behaviour of AES-WRAP-PAD (#25233)
- the EVP_Encrypt/Decrypt manual page is unclear in regards to the the decrypt
output size, however the proposed text is still not right. Shane will come up
with updates
- The EVP_EncryptInit manual page should document the generic API contract
under both the EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate headings;
cipher-specific details should be mentioned in the cipher-specific manpage.
