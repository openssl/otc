** Post Quantum

IETF are planning to encode PQ private keys as the seed, and not encoded in
an OCTET STRING. Unfortunately lots of implementations do not do this and
encode the long form private key. The IETF spec is still a draft.

Our strategy: if we have the seed we will write that format. Otherwise we will
write the long form. When reading we will detect what format we have.
It is not easy to write an encoder to take a parameter to optionally write a
seed or not. It is easier to "forget" the seed on import if we want to.

[Tomas Mraz joined]

Discussion about hybrid keys. No concrete plans for encoding/decoding of these.

Viktor should investigate whether "forgetting" the seed on import/key gen is a
viable option in order to force encoding the seedless format.

Discussion about LMS and whether to do verify only, or sign and verify. Doing
verify only for 3.5 was discussed. Ultimately the consensus was to skip LMS
verify for 3.5 and wait until we have both verify and signing. CNSA 2 is less of
an issue now. We might do LMS in the October release.

** Endian

A PR exists to load/store values to big/little endian support:

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/26385

A discussion about whether these functions should be public or not. There were
differing views. Some feel that we should keep them private for now. Others
that these are beneficial to others and it is useful to make them public.

OTC does not object to this being public and the hold will be removed.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)
