Discussed https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/26801:
- Enabling hybrid key shares with QUIC causes issues. Some tests seem to be
  failing if they are enabled for QUIC.
- Parsing the default supported groups configuration causes about 600 strcmp()
  calls. We've discussed ways how to speed this up.

There might be a problem with the X25519 keyshare not working in a libctx with
both default and fips providers and a property query "fips=yes". However this
is not a regression.
