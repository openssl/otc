** 3.5 Alpha release

Feature freeze is imminent. Should we create the 3.6 branch.
Some discussion of various features that are close to being merged but aren't
quite ready yet.

Discussion around branching for 3.5 on 11th March (at alpha time).

The following features are ok to go in when ready (before alpha):
- Intel optimisation (#26410)
- Decoder patch (#26892)
- KEM mode optional (#26872)
- Allow zero length plaintext and AEAD for AES SIV mode (#26658)

All other features will either be merged today, or should not be merged for the
alpha. The full freeze will occur 2 days prior the 11th March alpha release and
we will the create the 3.5 branch at this point.

** Review OTC project board

The outstanding project board issues have been added the engineering backlog.
Engineering team to review and consider whether they can be done for 3.5.

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

Make the KEM operating mode optional (#26872)

Each KEM has a "mode" and there is only one at the current time. This PR makes
that mode the default for each algorithm, without the caller having to explicitly
set it.

OTC is ok with setting these default modes.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed outstanding security issues.

** Review draft technical policies

None
