#27431 fips: Enforce lower bounds checks for password protected files when using
FIPS provider

Suggested approach is to change the default salt length to 16 in 3.6.
The current PR goes too far and would enforace the longer lengths and is therefore
breaking. This might be acceptable in 4.0.

We would accept a PR (in 3.6) that would change the default salt length to 16.
We do not want to change the enforcement in 3.x
