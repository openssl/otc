** ML-DSA codepoints

We have enabled ML-DSA TLS sigalgs in 3.5. However the codepoints are still
draft. There is a risk that the codepoints will not get assigned. We will
accept that risk.

** Beta sign off

Beta checklist:

Y The code is functionally complete in regards to the particular release objectives as set by OMC and OTC.
Y There is no remaining refactoring required by OMC or OTC for the release.
Y There are no remaining API changes required for the release. This applies only to beta releases of a major release as API changes are not allowed on minor releases.
Y There are no remaining API additions required for the release.
Y All issues triaged as regressions on the development branch from which the release is to be done must have a milestone assigned. Regressions are considered from the previous stable release or previous beta release.
Y All issues or pull requests with the milestone for the beta release are closed.
Y There are no outstanding untriaged Coverity issues.
Y Coveralls coverage has not decreased overall from the previous release.
N The CI must pass on the tip of the development branch before the release commits are added to the tree, including the daily CI builds.
Y The tree must be frozen for at least 3 business days. No changes apart from regression or security fixes should be merged during the freeze.
N For 2 days before the release there should be no changes to ensure the daily CI builds run on the development tree tip.
 In case of the first beta release the OTC should explicitly approve that the source is ready for a release with a vote.

OTC sign off the beta release subject to the provider compatibility CI issue being fixed.
