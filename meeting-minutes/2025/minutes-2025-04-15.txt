** Policy for feature branches

What is allowed to be merged into a feature branch. Do we apply the same level
of rules to what is allowed into master, into a feature branch.

Original intent was to review PRs as if they were being merged to master. There
might be TODOs left in the code to resolve later. Discussion about whether
there should always be a TODO or whether sometimes things could be captured
externally in an issue.

Some discussion how to handle small disagreements between the author and
reviewers.

The feature branch is considered a staging branch for master. Development occurs
in the PR branch.

There are three options for resolving disagreements in a PR review for a feature
branch:
1) Author and reviewers agree to a compromise
2) Author and reviewers agree to defer the issue until some later time
3) Author or reviewers use the exception process (e.g. OTC Hold to resolve the
   disagreement)

Dmitry raised the point that from an external contributor perspective getting
review at all for feature branches is a problem.

** X509_NAME_oneline

We have a non-standard encoding of directory names via X509_NAME_oneline. We
do have functions that implement standard ways of encoding (X509_NAME_print_ex)
- however we are still using X509_NAME_oneline in various places.
(See PR #27370)

Consensus is that we should display RFC standard names but this should be from
4.0. We should raise an issue to review all uses of X509_NAME_oneline.

** Configuration parsing

See issue #27300

Processing of .include directories in config files is not deterministic in terms
of the order that files are processed. We should sort them first. We should
fix in the next minor release (but not backport).

** Review issues with OTC hold (30 minutes)

There are none.

** Review outstanding security issues

We discussed security issues

** Review draft technical policies

None
