** SHAKE and CMS

The SHAKE digests should have a default length in the CMS context.

Two possibilities were proposed.

- Hard code the length in the CMS context.
- If you load the digest by OID then load a version of SHAKE witht the correct
default digest length

The second option does not seem viable. The first option seems the only viable
one prior to 4.0. After 4.0 we could just change the default digest length - but
this may not be desirable if we want to still support old providers.

Another option considered was a special case in EVP_DigestFinal.
